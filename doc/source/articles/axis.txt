when summing, axis 0 sums rows (delivering labels of the axis 1)
when summing, axis 1 sums columns (delivering labels of the axis 0)

when iterating, axis 0 iters by column (delivering labels of axis 0, post apply has labels for axis 1)
when iterating, axis 1 iters by row (delivering labels of axis 1)
axis is axis along which we iterate: 0 iterates along

when grouping, axis 0 iters groups selected by values in a column (groups are groups of rows)
when grouping, axis 1 iters groups selected by values in a row (groups are groups of columns)

for Quilt:
native _axis 0 means Bus components are stacked vertically, but aligned by columns
native _axis 1 means Bus components are stacked horizontally, but aligned by index


for Frame.from_concat:
axis 0 means concat vertically (aligning on columns), same as np.concatenate(axis=0)
axis 1 means concat horizontally (aligning on rows), same as np.concatenate(axis=1)



pandas apply axis 0 applies func per columns (same sf's iter axis 0 with apply)
pandas apply axis 1 applies func per row (same sf's iter axis 1 with apply)

for axis 0, the function is "appled along the row axis", i.e, each function is given a series with axis 0 labels
