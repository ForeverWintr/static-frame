static-frame
=============

The StaticFrame library consists of the Series and Frame classes, immutable (or grow-only) data structures for one- and two- dimensional calculations with self-aligning, labelled axis. StaticFrame extends NumPy, relying on NumPy entirely for all vector processing and retaining the full range of NumPy array data types.
